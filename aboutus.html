            Nepal, country of Asia, lying along the southern slopes of the Himalayan mountain ranges. It is a landlocked
            country located between India to the east, south, and west and the Tibet Autonomous Region of China to the
            north. Its territory extends roughly 500 miles (800 kilometres) from east to west and 90 to 150 miles from
            north to south. The capital is Kathmandu.

            Nepal, long under the rule of hereditary prime ministers favouring a policy of isolation, remained closed to
            the outside world until a palace revolt in 1950 restored the crown’s authority in 1951; the country gained
            admission to the United Nations in 1955. In 1991 the kingdom established a multiparty parliamentary system.
            In 2008, however, after a decadelong period of violence and turbulent negotiation with a strong Maoist
            insurgency, the monarchy was dissolved, and Nepal was declared a democratic republic.

            Wedged between two giants, India and China, Nepal seeks to keep a balance between the two countries in its
            foreign policy—and thus to remain independent. A factor that contributes immensely to the geopolitical
            importance of the country is the fact that a strong Nepal can deny China access to the rich Gangetic Plain;
            Nepal thus marks the southern boundary of the Chinese sphere north of the Himalayas in Asia.
